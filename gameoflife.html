        <h2>About Game of Life</h2>
        <p>
          A C++ project built at Full Sail University to demonstrate
          object-oriented programming, memory management, and problem-solving
          using Conway's Game of Life. Implemented core concepts like control
          structures, 2D arrays, and dynamic memory.

      <h3 class="introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This project was originally assigned as a computer science assignment at
        Full Sail University. It taught me a wide range of foundational
        programming and computer science skills. I gained experience with core
        concepts such as control structures (if, for, while), functions, and
        using 2D arrays to represent and manipulate the game grid. It reinforced
        my problem-solving skills through logic-based rules, like counting
        neighboring cells and updating the grid without disrupting ongoing
        calculations. The project was structured using object-oriented
        programming (OOP), which gave me practice with encapsulation,
        abstraction, and access specifiers. It also introduced memory management
        concepts, including dynamic allocation, pointers, and preventing memory
        leaks with proper use of destructors. Key features such as customizable
        rules, dynamic grid resizing, and support for both finite and toroidal
        simulation modes demonstrate the project’s adaptability and depth.
      </p>
      <h3>Finite & Toroidal Mode</h3>
      <p>
        The implementation of both toroidal and finite edge behaviors in the
        Game of Life simulation adds significant depth and flexibility to how
        patterns evolve over time. In toroidal mode, the grid behaves as if its
        edges are connected—cells on the far left can interact with those on the
        far right, and cells at the top connect to those at the bottom. This
        creates a continuous simulation space with no boundaries, allowing
        patterns to loop infinitely and evolve in more complex, uninterrupted
        ways. It’s particularly useful for studying how structures behave in
        limitless environments, and it introduces unique interactions not seen
        in finite simulations. In contrast, the finite mode treats the grid
        edges as hard boundaries. Cells on the border have fewer neighbors,
        which naturally impacts how certain patterns like gliders or oscillators
        behave when they reach the edge. This finite simulation space is
        valuable for understanding constrained environments, where edge
        interactions matter, and it introduces a layer of strategy in observing
        how patterns grow, die, or stabilize. Together, these two modes offer a
        more complete exploration of cellular automata dynamics and required
        careful logic branching to ensure accurate simulation behavior in both
        scenarios.

      <h3>Neighbor Count</h3>
      <p>
        I ncorporated a neighbor-counting algorithm to determine the fate of
        each cell in the simulation. For every cell on the grid, I evaluated its
        eight surrounding neighbors to calculate how many were alive. This count
        plays a crucial role in applying the core rules of the game—whether a
        cell survives, dies, or is born in the next generation. I ensured that
        the counting logic correctly handled both finite and toroidal edge
        cases, where cells at the borders needed special consideration depending
        on the selected simulation mode. This system forms the backbone of the
        game's logic, allowing for accurate and dynamic pattern evolution frame
        by frame.

      <h3>Resizing, Randomize, Grid Lines, and 10 X 10 Lines</h3>
      <p>
        I added several interactive features to enhance the usability and
        flexibility of the Game of Life simulation. The resizing function allows
        users to dynamically adjust the dimensions of the gameboard, giving them
        control over the simulation scale and enabling more complex or compact
        patterns. The randomize feature populates the grid with a randomly
        generated configuration of live and dead cells, offering a quick way to
        observe emergent behaviors without manually placing each cell. I also
        implemented grid lines to visually separate cells, making the simulation
        clearer and easier to follow. Additionally, a 10x10 line overlay helps
        users track larger sections of the board, supporting better spatial
        organization and aiding in debugging or design of specific structures.
        These features collectively improve user experience by making the
        simulation more customizable, visual, and engaging.

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>
        Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of 2D data
        structures and algorithmic logic in C++, which was essential for
        accurately simulating the Game of Life. I gained valuable experience
        building a real-time simulation with a strong focus on both performance
        and accuracy. Along the way, I learned how to effectively debug complex
        issues related to indexing and memory management, particularly when
        working with dynamic arrays and pointer-based structures. I also applied
        function pointers to design a modular and extensible rule system,
        allowing the simulation logic to be easily expanded or customized.
        Overall, this project helped build my confidence in developing scalable,
        interactive systems from the ground up.
