      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="about-text">
        I'm Kasey Russell, a passionate game developer focused on creating
        immersive, systems-driven gameplay using C++ with Unreal Engine and C#
        with Unity. I specialize in interactive mechanics, smart AI behaviors,
        and responsive systems that make each session feel dynamic and engaging.
        I take pride in writing clean, modular code and thrive in both
        collaborative and solo development environments. My mission is to design
        unique experiences that not only play well but feel alive—games where
        every mechanic supports player freedom, creativity, and challenge.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        My development philosophy centers on gameplay-first design, where every
        feature is built to enhance the player's agency and immersion. I strive
        to create systems that feel intuitive, polished, and alive—whether I’m
        designing challenging enemy behaviors, interactive mechanics, or
        dynamic, reactive environments. I take pride in writing clean, modular
        code that’s easy to scale and maintain, allowing for seamless iteration
        and long-term project health. I believe that great gameplay emerges
        through tight feedback loops, where constant testing and player input
        shape and refine the experience. Collaboration is at the heart of my
        process—I value open communication with artists, designers, and other
        developers to bring shared visions to life. My goal is always to create
        gameplay systems that not only work technically but feel purposeful and
        exciting, encouraging players to explore, experiment, and stay engaged.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I earned my degree from Full Sail University, where I developed strong
        skills in C++ and C#, along with a versatile toolkit essential for both
        game development and software engineering. My education emphasized
        hands-on, project-based learning, giving me experience in
        problem-solving, rapid prototyping, version control, Java, SQL, UI/UX
        design, and more. I’m constantly learning and adapting—exploring new
        techniques, tools, and frameworks to sharpen my abilities and stay
        current in a fast-moving industry. Whether it's diving into a new engine
        feature or refining a custom gameplay system, I'm driven by a desire to
        keep improving and creating more engaging experiences. Outside of active
        development, I enjoy analyzing games, deconstructing systems, and
        experimenting with mechanics to understand what makes gameplay feel
        satisfying and impactful. I believe that great games are built with both
        creativity and discipline—and I bring that mindset into everything I
        create.
